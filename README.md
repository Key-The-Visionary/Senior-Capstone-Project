ðŸ§¾ User Story Example:
Title: Research Machine learning techniques to help analyze malware in datasets

As a cybersecurity analyst,
I want to analyze malware in dynamic and static datasets by using different machine learning techniques. This will help to create a method that  helps us better evaluate and understand the effectiveness of analyzing malware.

âœ… Acceptance Criteria:

- The system should accept API call traces as input (in text format).

- The system should classify the input as malicious or benign with at least 90% accuracy on the validation set.

- The output should include a confidence score.

- The model must be trained on a labeled dataset of malware and benign samples.

ðŸ§  Additional Notes :

- The APIhashes are extracted from dynamic and static analysis.

- The detection model uses deep learning (e.g., LSTM or CNN) trained on sequences of API calls.

- The APIhashes of both static and dynamic malware and benign are merged together into a csv file.
